# Swagger

Swagger aides in development across the entire API lifecycle, from design and documentation, to test and deployment. 

## Using swagger

To use swagger we first need to start our service by running:

```
npm run start
```

Once our service is up and running we can go into the swagger directory

```
cd swagger
```

and start swagger tools using:

```
npm run start
```

Now both are service and swagger tools are running. To access the tools
we need to go on [swagger-tools](http://localhost:3001/docs).

Here we can find the documentation for our API.
